/**
 * Hard operational budget for the bounded cycle solver, and the single source of truth for its defaults.
 *
 * <p>
 * Every limit is an operational cut-off, never a correctness claim: exceeding one produces
 * {@link CycleSolveStatus#TOO_COMPLEX} or {@link CycleSolveStatus#UNKNOWN_BUDGET}, never a
 * missing-items verdict.
 *
 * <p>
 * Canonical stage-one defaults, mirrored by {@code planner.maxScc*} in the design document's Appendix B:
 * {@code maxKeys = 8}, {@code maxPatterns = 16}, {@code maxStates = 100000}, {@code maxFirings = 100000},
 * {@code maxSeedLadderSteps = 12}.
 *
 * @param maxKeys            relevant-key cap for one SCC; above it the component is {@code TOO_COMPLEX}
 * @param maxPatterns        pattern cap for one SCC; above it the component is {@code TOO_COMPLEX}
 * @param maxStates          distinct-marking cap shared by the first search and the whole seed ladder
 * @param maxFirings         search macro-step cap. A macro-step may contain a verified batch of the same pattern, so
 *                           this is no longer a cap on the exact pattern firing counts. It remains an operational cap,
 *                           not a mathematical guarantee: targets that need more interleaving steps remain unknown.
 * @param maxSeedLadderSteps number of doubling steps the seed ladder may verify
